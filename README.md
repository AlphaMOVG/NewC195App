How to run the program: Upon opening the application simply type test, or admin for the username and test, or admin for the password and it will log you in,
prompting you if there are any appointments within 15 minutes of logging in. from there it will take you to a select screen, where you can choose to view appointments,
customers, or reports. In the appointments scene you can create, update, and delete appointments. In the customer scene you can add, update, and delete customers.
and in the reports scene you can view reports. 
Additional report description: Aside from the reports we were required to create, I also created a report that reports how many customers there are per country.
